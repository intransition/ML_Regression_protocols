# ML_Regression_protocols
Contains a hand made protcol for benchmarking some regression algorithms against one dataset (public). 
Algorithms can be added and run a selectable number of times; a table with all the run metrics and their averages can be saved as a text file. 
The project does not include any further evaluations other than the metrics and in fact it survives just as a code source and educational resources for my courses.
The progress is in other libraries - notably pycaret and in the direction of automating and streamlining
(pyCaret, MLflow, Streamlit) to quickly setup a new ML lab.
An automated simple MLflow based regression notebook - containing only one model - elasticnet - was  added to this project just make comparison and assess  results between the two.
