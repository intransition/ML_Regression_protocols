# ML_Regression_protocols
Analogous to the binary classification, it contains a hand made protcol for benchmarking algos against one dataset (public).
Algorithms can be added and run in a fashion very similar to the pyCaret suite (which is much more complete).
Hence the project survives just as a code source and educational resources for my courses, but progress is currently in direction of automating and streamlining
(pyCaret, MLflow, Streamlit) to quickly setup a new ML lab.
An automated MLflow based regression notebook - containing only one - elsticnet - was  added to make comparison of results between the two.
